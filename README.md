# DOMArrayMethods

Based on course '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript' created by Brad Traversy (https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/), I would like to present a project 5/20: DOM Array Methods.

* Fetch random users from the randomuser.me API
* Use forEach() to loop and output user/wealth
* Use map() to double wealth
* Use filter() to filter only millionaires
* Use sort() to sort by wealth
* Use reduce() to add all wealth
